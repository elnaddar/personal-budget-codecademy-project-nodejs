# Personal Budget
For this project, you will build an API that allows clients to create
and manage a personal budget. Using [Envelope
Budgeting](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-envelope-budgeting-1293682)
principles, your API should allow users to manage budget envelopes and
track the balance of each envelope. Your API should follow best
practices regarding REST endpoint naming conventions, proper response
codes, etc. Make sure to include data validation to ensure users do not
overspend their budget!
